3D Green Function Generation
----------------------------

``GF3D`` can help you create a Green function database, but underneat all of it,
it's still ``specfem3d_globe`` that generates the 3D seismograms. So, hopefully
this page will help you to get from a working ``specfem3d_globe`` installation
to a Green function database. Throughout this, we will cover some important
topics such as aliasing, subsampling, and precision, all of which are needed to
make the right decision for your database of 3D Green functions.
